# HALT REPORT

**Generated:** 2026-01-20T22:04:36Z

## What Failed

**Failure IDs:** F-AUTHORITY-ROLE
**Invariant IDs:** INV_AUTHORITY_ROLE_INTEGRITY

**Summary:** Antigravity attempted to read a restricted prompt "ANTIGRAVITY", which is an unauthorized action for the current role configuration.

### Details

- Antigravity invoked `read_prompt(name="ANTIGRAVITY")`.
- The system returned `UNAUTHORIZED_ACTION`.
- The audit system detected the breach and engaged the global kill-switch.

## Why the System Halted

The system triggered a global kill-switch because:

1. One or more critical invariants were violated (INV_AUTHORITY_ROLE_INTEGRITY).
2. The system cannot guarantee safe continued operation without forensic verification.
3. Manual human intervention (acknowledgement) is required.

### Trigger Information

- **Triggered by Tool:** read_prompt
- **Triggered by Role:** ANTIGRAVITY
- **Trigger Reason:** Unauthorized prompt access attempt.

## What is Safe to Do Next

✓ **SAFE OPERATIONS:**

- Read audit log (for forensic analysis)
- Read plan files
- Read workspace files
- Generate attestation bundles
- Run verification tools (read-only)
- Inspect workspace integrity

## What is Explicitly FORBIDDEN

✗ **FORBIDDEN OPERATIONS:**

- Writing to workspace files
- Creating new plans
- Executing plans
- Bootstrapping new plans
- Any mutation of state

## Recovery Path

To recover from this halt:

1. **Read the full audit log** to understand the sequence of events.
2. **Acknowledge this halt report** (Human confirmation required).
3. **Run required verifications:** `audit_verify`, `plan_lint`.
4. **Unlock the kill-switch** via `recovery-gate`.
